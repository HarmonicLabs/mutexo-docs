Documentation for both [`mutexo-server`](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/mutexo-server) and [`mutexo-client`](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/mutexo-client) libraries

### Installing
```
npm install
```

### Local Development

You can run:

```
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
