Mutexo is a tool for UTxO synchronization.

When building on utxo-based blockchain like cardano, if you want to desing truly decentralzied applications,
utxo contention is always something you need to worry about.

Mutexo helps to solve utxo contention by providing a centralized offchain synchronization system for a decentralized on-chain design.

While this tool is centralzed, it has **no effect on-chain**, applications should be able to work without this tool.

Mutexo turns useful in a honest environment, greatly improving the UX of the utxo-based application.

This documentation covers [`mutexo-server`](./server/getting-started) CLI and [`mutexo-client`](./client/getting-started) APIs.
