# `sub`

The `sub` method primary purpose is to notify the server that we are interested to receive some events.

## Signature

```typescript
async sub<EvtName extends MutexoClientEvtName>( eventName: EvtName, evtHandler?: ( msg: DataOf<EvtName> ) => void ): Promise<SubSuccess | SubFailure>
async sub<EvtName extends MutexoClientEvtName>( eventName: EvtName, filters?: Filter[], evtHandler?: ( msg: DataOf<EvtName> ) => void ): Promise<SubSuccess | SubFailure>
async sub<EvtName extends MutexoClientEvtName>(
    eventName: EvtName,
    filters?: Filter[] | (( msg: DataOf<EvtName> ) => void),
    evtHandler?: ( msg: DataOf<EvtName> ) => void,
): Promise<SubSuccess | SubFailure>
```

### Parameters

#### Overload 1

- `eventName`: [`MutexoClientEvtName`](../types/MutexoClientEvtName)
- `evtHandler` (optional): an event listener to be added using [`addEventListener`](./addEventListener) only in case of success

#### Overload 2

- `eventName`: [`MutexoClientEvtName`](../types/MutexoClientEvtName)
- `filters` (optional): [`Filter`](../types/Filter)[]
- `evtHandler` (optional): an event listener to be added using [`addEventListener`](./addEventListener) only in case of success

### Returns

A promise that resolves to one of the following messages:
- `SubSuccess`: Indicates that the subscription was successful.
- `SubFailure`: Indicates that the subscription failed.

## Description

The `sub` method sends a subscription request to the server and waits for a response indicating whether the subscription was successful or not.

The method throws an error if the message sent to the server was ill formed, but not if the subscription was well formed and fails.

Insted if the subscription fails; the result will be instance of either `SubFailure`.

If the subscription is successful, a `SubSuccess` is returned.

After a succesful subscription, the client will emit events corresponding to the [`MutexoClientEvtName`](../types/MutexoClientEvtName) specified, using [`dispatchEvent`](./dispatchEvent).

To handle the events emitted you need to add an event listener for the event you subscribed to.

You can do so either by calling [`addEventListener`](./addEventListener) directly, or by passing the `evtHandler` parameter (that will call [`addEventListener`](./addEventListener) for you **only in case of success**)

:::warning event listeners do not account for filters

event listeners passed either as `evtHandler` or added using [`addEventListener`](./addEventListener)
will be called for every event triggered for the client.

this means that if you subscribe two times with different filters,
both the event listener will be called every time,
regardless of the filters sent with the subscription.

You can check if an event received satisfies the filters by calling the [`satisfiesFilters`](../event_methods/satisfiesFilters)
method present on the event message, as shown in the [second example below](#only-input-events-of-a-single-address).

## Examples

### All `"input"` events

```ts
const client = new MutexoClient(webSocket);

const utxoSpentHandler = _evt => {
    console.log("someone spent something")
};

// no filters specified
// the client will receive ALL events
// about ALL addresses followed by the server
client.addEventListener("input", utxoSpentHandler);

const subResult = await client.sub("input");

if(!( subResult instanceof SubSuccess ))
{
    console.log("subscription was not successful, event listener was not added");
}
```

### Only `"input"` events of a single address

```ts
const client = new MutexoClient(webSocket);

const myFavoriteAddress = "addr1...";
// only receive notifications
// about inputs spent by myFavoriteAddress
const filters = [
    { addr: myFavoriteAddress }
];

const utxoSpentHandler = evt => {
    // the handler is still called for every event triggered for the client
    // if you have mutliple subscriptsion, the filters will accumulate
    if( !evt.satisfiesFilters( filters ) ) return;

    console.log("my favorite address spent something")
};

const subResult = await client.sub(
    "input",
    filters,
    utxoSpentHandler
);

if(!( subResult instanceof SubSuccess ))
{
    console.log("subscription was not successful, event listener was not added");
}
```
